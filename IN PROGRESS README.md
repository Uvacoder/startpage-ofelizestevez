## Overview + Notes
I'm naming this website Just Another Terminal (JUT) since this ideas is not original (actually inspired by others in [r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/)). I started this project just as a personal start page but decided to share it with others since it has dynamic elements to it, such as a theme changer and the ability to create new commands/bookmarks.

One important note would be to remember that this terminal is case-sensitive, therefore typing in commands such as "Help" or "HELP" will not invoke the "help" command.

## Usage
One could either use the version hosted on github, or host the files on their computer. 

<!-- ADD GIF OF -->
<!-- ADD HYPERLINK -->
The address for the version hosted on github is: https://ofelizestevez.github.io/

Either way, you're going to want to change your browser's startup and/or homepage to the address either through an extension or your browser's settings.

## Commands
This startpage uses commands of different functionality to work. Some commands are simple link redirectors which redirect to differnet websites, others are more complex.

## Support and Limitations
If you have any suggestions, whether different themes or how to optimize the code or any custom commands I should create, please contact me or create an issue on the repo.

If you have any suggestions for the create template commands, please contact or create an issue as well. For now, one can only create "link openers".

Also, the subreddit autocomplete function is based off of a hard-coded list of my subreddit list. In the future I will create a popular default list, with a way to change the list from the commands. One limitation to this command could possibly be the use of JS localStorage which has a max size of 5MB per website. 

I should also point out that this website will most likely never have a database attached to it.
