1. Inputting "help" as a command

    This command prints out a table of all the commands and short descriptions for each command
    ```
    help
    ```

2. inputting "--help" as a command argument

    This command prints the usage/command example for the specific command.

### "create" command
the "create" command is a command which saves user-generated commands based off of templates to the browser's LocalStorage. Currently, the only template supported is the link template, which works as a bookmark which redirects you to another link.

This command uses a helper function named link_handler() to handle improper links, which means you won't have to include "https://" , "www." , or ".com" when making a link. This does have a limitation where if you'd like to link to an "http://" address, you will need to include it in the [ARGUMENT]. Similarly, if you'd like to link to a subdirectory, you will need to include the ".com" and the subdirectory in the argument. Lastly, since this handler assumes the website is a ".com", if you'd like to go to a website with another ending, you're going to need to include it as well.

Note: using general command names or shortened command names that were already a part of the command list will override them. This could be a good thing or a bad thing.

#### Usage
```
create [TEMPLATE] [COMMAND NAME] [ARGUMENT] [SHORTENED COMMAND NAME](OPTIONAL)
```

```
create link [COMMAND NAME] [LINK] [SHORTENED COMMAND NAME](OPTIONAL)
```

One thing to note here is that the shortened command name is optional.

#### Examples

This example will create a command that redirects to https://github.com/
```
create link github github gh
```

This example will create a command that redirects to https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Haimchar_Upazila
```
create link haimchar wikipedia.org/wiki/Haimchar_Upazila
```

This example will create a command that redirects to http://www.staggeringbeauty.com/
```
create link staggeringbeauty http://staggeringbeauty sb
```

---

### "remove" command

the "remove" command is a counterpart to the "create" command, meaning that it can delete or remove a user-generated command. The shortened named for this command is rm. In order to remove a command, you need to use it's general name, not the shortened name.

#### Usage
```
remove [COMMAND NAME]
```

#### Example
```
remove github
```


---

### "background" command

This command changes the theme of the terminal by changing the background and the command prefix colors. There's currently no way to change or add any backgrounds or your own prefix colors. If you'd like this feature to be added, let me know!

There are currently 5 default backgrounds.

#### Usage
```
background [NUM]
```
```
bg [NUM]
```


#### Example
```
background 0
```
```
bg 1
```

---

### "backup" command

"backup" is another simple command with no arguments which downloads a .json of your commands created with the "create" command. This is useful for transfering your commands between devices and restoring them in case they get deleted.

#### Usage & Example
```
backup
```

---

### "Restore" command

"restore" is a command with no arguments that is the counterpart to the backup command. There is currently no check to make sure that the file uploaded is a file generated by the website, so if you upload a random file, it might override your commands.

#### Usage & Example
```
restore
```
